# Konbini Japanese Convenience

### Lambda Functions | DynamoDB | Cognito | API Gateway | REST Api | React

Konbini is inspired by the Konbiniya Japanese Center on Robson Street. We frequented this store when we were younger for Japanese snacks and have fond memories of buying soft-serve from their window.

This app is a loose rebranding of their website: ![Shop Kobiniya](https://shop.konbiniya.com/)
It features a React front-end that allows users to browse the product available. Admin are are able utilize CRUD functions to updatate their inventory (add a product, edit a product, change the quantity in inventory, delete a product).

Sample JSON data:

{
"product": {
"category":"Instant noodles",
